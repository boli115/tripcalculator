Project name: TripCalculator
Programmer: Bo Li
Domain: Trip Calculator; Interface: Native GUI; Platform: .NET; Backend: C#

This application is coded in C# with pure .NET library in Visual Studio 2015, no special packages 
needed. Just open the .csproj file and Run. The results are displayed whenever changes to the data 
fields occur, no "Calculate" button to click. The frame work of handling more people is there, but 
it has not been coded or tested. Total hours used is around 5 hours.

This application demonstrated the following techniques:
1.	Simple data structure using “struct”
2.	Data structure using a class with build in functions
3.	Reading and writing XML files to save user data
4.	Using Threading to handle lengthy processes to ensure the best user experience
5.	Using DataSource to bind data objects to the DataGridView
6.	Using Delegate to handle cross threads display
7.	Access the Events that are not exposed in Visual Studio IDE
8.	Ensure only numeric values are accepted in the numeric text fields
9.	Using asynchronous methods to handle lengthy processes to ensure the best user experience
10.	Sorting a list of objects by one of the fields
11.	Use extension methods to make coding easier
12.	Override the stock control to add more functions

Thank you very much for your consideration! I am looking forward to joining the team.
